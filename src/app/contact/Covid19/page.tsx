        With the current pandemic continuing to spread, it is imperative that building owners take necessary steps to improve the indoor air
        quality (IAQ) of their buildings, and do what they can to help limit the spread of contaminants via their buildings' HVAC systems. The
        HVAC system in a building plays a crucial role in the IAQ. As each building is unique, there are a wide range of options and approaches
        which can be taken to reduce the spread of pathogens. These can include airflow, ventilation, filtration, humidity, HVAC retrofit equipment
        and control strategies.
